# Connect 4

## Project Description 
Connect-Four is a two-player game in which players alternately take turns dropping colored checkers in an attempt to achieve four pieces in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line. Because the board is vertical, pieces inserted in a given column always drop to the lowest available place of that column. To win Connect Four, all you have to do is connect four of your colored checker pieces in a row, much the same as tic tac toe.
